# Intro

I am currently seeking new opportunities as a Full Stack Developer. I previously worked at Fields Software Company until 2023 as a Web Developer, where I specialized in building web applications using React and Node.js. I worked as a Housing Management Specialist in the public sector at the Korea Government, managing public housing programs and applications. I am now in the final year of my Master's degree in Information Technology at Queensland University of Technology, focusing on Computer Science.

# Some History

- I grew up in Seoul, Korea, where societal pressure led me to pursue a stable career, even though it wasn't what I truly wanted.
- After spending a year focused on exam preparation, I became a public servant with intense competition. However, I quickly realized the role didn’t align with my interests and knew I couldn’t continue in it long-term.
- This led me to explore new paths, and I eventually discovered web development. Since it was something I could easily learn on my own, I began studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my spare time after work. Building websites sparked my interest and made me realize I could enjoy and pursue this work long-term.
- I landed a role as a Web Developer and was later promoted to Tech Lead at my previous company. However, my desire to continue learning led me to leave and pursue further studies.
- In August 2024, my team and I developed GitPortfolio, a customizable GitHub portfolio web application using React, Node.js, and Express, which we showcased at the UQ Hackathon 2024, where we ranked in the top 5.
- In my first year, I completed units focusing on networking, algorithms, Linux systems, C language, and cybersecurity, which enabled me to build a strong foundation in computer science.
- After finishing my first year, during the summer break, I developed a full-stack app based on my own idea to manage team schedules. This app helps find the optimal time for all team members to meet.
- Currently, I'm more interested in AI technologies, so this year, I'm taking advanced courses such as Natural Language Processing, machine learning algorithms.
