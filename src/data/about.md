# Intro

I am currently seeking new opportunities as a Full Stack Developer. I previously worked at Fields Software Company until 2023 as a Web Developer, where I specialized in building web applications using React and Node.js. I worked as a Housing Management Specialist in the public sector at the Korea Government, managing public housing programs and applications.

# Some History

- I grew up in Seoul, Korea, where societal pressure pushed me toward a stable career. After a year of exam preparation, I became a public servant, but I quickly realized the role didnâ€™t align with my interests.
- Seeking a new path, I discovered web development and started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my spare time. Building websites ignited my passion, and I realized this was a career I truly wanted to pursue.
- I started as a Web Developer and was promoted to Tech Lead, thanks to my strong communication skills and ability to collaborate effectively with clients. However,I wanted to broaden my expertise beyond similar client projects, so I pursued further studies to explore new technologies and advance my career.
- In my first year, I completed units focusing on networking, algorithms, Linux systems, C language, and cybersecurity, which enabled me to build a strong foundation in computer science.
- In August 2024, my team and I developed GitPortfolio, a customizable GitHub portfolio web application using React, Node.js, and Express. We showcased it at the UQ Hackathon 2024, where we ranked in the top 5.
- After completing my first year, during the summer break, I developed a full-stack app based on my own idea to manage team schedules, helping teams find the optimal time to meet. During the same break, I also gained hands-on experience with cloud platforms like Azure and AWS.
