# Intro

I am currently seeking new opportunities as a Full Stack Developer. I previously worked at Fields Software Company until 2023 as a Web Developer, where I specialized in building web applications using React and Node.js. I worked as a Housing Management Specialist in the public sector at the Korea Government, managing public housing programs and applications. I am now in the final year of my Master's degree in Information Technology at Queensland University of Technology, focusing on Computer Science.

# Some History

- I was born and raised in Seoul, Korea, where I received a competitive education that led me to pursue a stable job.
- I secured a stable position as a public servant and worked there for almost two years, but I realized that this career path was not fulfilling and decided to pursue a different direction.
- I began learning HTML and CSS and started building websites, which sparked my interest in web development. When I picked up JavaScript, my passion for the field grew even more.
- I landed a role as a Web Developer and was later promoted to Tech Lead at my previous company. However, my desire to continue learning led me to leave and pursue further studies.
- My team and I developed GitPortfolio, a customizable GitHub portfolio web application using React, Node.js, and Express, which we showcased at the UQ Hackathon 2024, where we ranked in the top 5.
- In my first year, I completed units focusing on networking, algorithms, Linux systems, C language, and cybersecurity, which enabled me to build a strong foundation in computer science.
- After finishing my first year, during the summer break, I developed a full-stack app based on my own idea to manage team schedules. This app helps find the optimal time for all team members to meet.
