## Intro

Creative and detail-oriented, with a passion for turning ideas into visually compelling and user-friendly solutions.
I previously worked at Fields Software Company until 2023 as a Web Developer, where I specialized in building web applications using React and Node.js. I worked as construction project manager in the public sector at the local Government in Korea, managing public housing programs and applications.

## Some History

# From Project Coordinator to Discovering Web Development

Before switching to IT, I worked as a Project Coordinator in the public sector, reviewing architectural plans and managing public construction projects.  
However, I realized it wasn’t the right fit for me. During that time, I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a side interest and soon became passionate about web programming.  
I built my first website to showcase the side projects I created while learning — you can view it here : [First Portfolio website](https://phs8197.github.io/Portfolio_2/).

# Transition to Front-End Development

After changing careers, I worked as a Front-End Developer at a small startup software company.  
I was responsible for building websites requested by clients, which involved frequent communication to understand their needs.  
Working closely with designers and backend engineers, I was involved from start to finish — a valuable experience that strengthened my collaboration skills and gave me insight into the full web development process.

# Studying Computer Science in Australia & Future Goals

Since moving to Australia, I have been studying Computer Science to broaden my knowledge in networking, algorithms, and system design.  
While I enjoy the theoretical foundation, I’m especially drawn to web development — a fast-paced field where new technologies constantly emerge.  
I am eager to grow in roles where I can deepen my expertise across the full stack and contribute to innovative projects that create meaningful user experiences.
